# 📌 Image Segmentation
## 📁 Overview
This project explores image segmentation using **algorithms**, treating an image as a graph where pixels or regions are nodes connected by edges based on similarity. The aim is to partition the image into coherent segments using algorithmic techniques.

## 🎯 Objective
To segment an image into meaningful regions by applying graph algorithms, without relying on machine learning. The focus is on efficient and interpretable algorithmic solutions to the segmentation problem.

## 🧠 Methodology

### Graph Representation
- Each pixel or superpixel is represented as a **node**.
- Edges connect neighboring nodes with weights based on color or intensity difference.

### Segmentation Algorithm
- Implemented **Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher’s Graph-Based Segmentation** algorithm:
  - Greedy approach to merge regions based on edge weights and internal differences.
  - Uses a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure for region management.

### Post-processing
- Removed small segments below a size threshold to reduce noise and improve clarity.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the input image.
2. Construct a graph where pixels are nodes and edges are based on pixel similarity.
3. Apply the graph segmentation algorithm to partition the image.
4. Post-process and display the segmented output.

## 📊 Results
- Successfully segmented various test images into coherent regions.
- Efficient runtime with graph-based approach.
- Visual output clearly differentiates regions using color labeling.

## 📚 Applications
- Image simplification and preprocessing.
- Object boundary detection.
- Real-time image analysis where machine learning is impractical.

## 📌 Notes
- Parameters like the similarity threshold and minimum component size greatly influence the segmentation quality.
- Future work could include applying the algorithm to video frames or extending it with superpixel preprocessing.
